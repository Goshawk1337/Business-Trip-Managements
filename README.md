# The project
I'm working on this project in my freetime, because I've seen an internship, and it had a kinda detailed description about what they needed. 

# Whats done?
- Front-end is done partially, its need minor changes, also currently the design is mobile oriented so on a bigger screen the UI looks awful .

# What needs to be done?
- Back-end work.
- Front-end changes(Such as fix the look on bigger screens.)

The project uses [ShadCN](https://ui.shadcn.com)
This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
